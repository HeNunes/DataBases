# DataBases
Projects dedicated to Database studies. The first requires the development of an Entity-Relationship mapping based on a requirements text, mapped into a Relational model used to create a relational database populated with fictional data, and finally, perform some queries

The second project follows the same idea as the previous one, but now the Extended-Entity-Relationship model was used for the mapping processes. Furthermore, the data used to populate the base was extracted from the Airbnb website, along with a normalization process.
